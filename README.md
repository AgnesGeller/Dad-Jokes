# Dad Joke Generator

This project is a web application that generates random dad jokes using the icanhazdadjoke API. It features a new morphism design made with CSS, which gives the app a soft and modern look. 

## How it works

The app consists of a simple interface with a text area and a button. Clicking on the button will fetch a random dad joke from the API and display it in the text area. You can click the button again to get a new joke. While the app is loading the joke, a loading effect is shown in the text and button to indicate the progress. The app also handles potential errors from the API and shows a friendly message to the user.

## Technologies used

The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main features of the app are:

- New morphism design: The app uses CSS properties such as box-shadow, border-radius, and background-color to create a new morphism effect, which is a design trend that mimics the look of soft and extruded shapes.
- Loading effect: The app uses JavaScript to create a loading effect that changes the text and button color and opacity while the app is fetching the joke from the API. The loading effect also uses CSS transitions to create a smooth animation.
- Error handling: The app uses JavaScript to catch any errors from the API and display a message to the user in the text area. The app also checks if the joke is empty or undefined and shows a different message accordingly.
